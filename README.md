// Peer Review: Joseph Poncini - Site overall looks very impressive. On desktop I think you nailed the sizing and spacing between the different Cards. As far as file structure goes you could probably make your code a lot better of a place to be in and debug if you compartementalize it a bit more. The cards on the tops for example all have the same format so they couldve been a component and then you just pass in the info you need with props. 

I found really only two descrepencies between your site and the prototype

1. The bar underneath the header on Mobile extends a bit too wide, it should go past the width of the cards below
2. On hovering the toggle switch the "Dark Mode" text is supposed to turn white. Very hard to catch on the prototypes and a bit of a challenge to implement so precede at your own caution

Everything else is great thought. Overall impressive feat
